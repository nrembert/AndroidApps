For all android app work

##EMOLLIENT
Emollient is a soap company my friend made and so I made this app for them. It is build in react native and has the ability to be built for android or IOS. If you are interested in an APK I can download one for you. An APK can be found in the top level folder if you want to mess around. This app is probably 80% done, most of it was scraped from their website and a few of the one-off screens could use some TLC with formatting. It is in closed beta on the android google play store.

You can also find the web scraping tool I developed here, it scraps a WIX website and extracts the data into JSON format, I then read in the scraped data to populate the application
